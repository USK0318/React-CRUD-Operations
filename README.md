# React-Django CRUD Operations and Dashboards

This project demonstrates basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using React.js for the frontend and Django for the backend. It also includes dashboard components to visualize data from the backend.

## Features

- Create, read, update, and delete operations for entities via RESTful APIs.
- Dashboard views to display analytics or summarized data.
- React.js for the frontend UI components.
- Django for the backend server and REST API endpoints.
- Database integration (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL) for storing data.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed before setting up the project:

- Node.js (for running React.js)
- Python (with Django and pip for package management)
- Database system (SQLite, PostgreSQL, etc.)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/react-django-crud.git
   cd react-django-crud
   ```

2. **Setup the Django backend:**

   ```bash
   cd backend
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate   # Activate the virtual environment
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python manage.py migrate   # Apply migrations
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

3. **Setup the React frontend:**

   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

4. **Access the application:**

   Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to view the React frontend.

## Usage

- Use the React frontend to interact with the Django backend through the provided API endpoints.
- Navigate through different CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) using the UI.
- Explore the dashboard components to visualize data fetched from the backend.
